    <h1>Breaking Opinion: The Newest Magic the Gathering set is Cool</h1>
    <h2>Showcase and Other art styles</h2>
    <p>Magic the Gathering (the only MTG that should be known) is a nerdy card game involving strategy. I won't lie, it's a weird game/hobby to have in my 30's, however the multitude of artists that get to have their art seen and used by millions of people globally is what really attracted me to the game. The showcase treatment, where each set has a limited number of cards recieve a variant treatment with a specific art style, has been my focus since Strixhaven (a previously released set in 2020). In the newest set, March of the Machines, we see special treatment given to a much larger amount of cards, and each treatment represents a different plane (or expansion) of the card games history. This includes a few that call back to the Strixhaven set, updated monster looking cards from Ikoria, and debut frames for several other planes predating the special treatments. Judith, the Scourge Diva has a new look for Ravinca, and it is such a cool looking card my husband will let me make him a new deck to play. Fortunately, I have a lot of fun art cards between the special treatments in different sets, and some Secret Lair products I have purchased. I think it will be a visually striking deck, and I am hoping to figure out what the strategy will be.  </p>
